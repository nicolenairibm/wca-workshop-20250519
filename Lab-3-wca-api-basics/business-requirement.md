# Business Requirements Document for Python Application with Backend and Frontend Interface

## Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the specifications for a simple Python application with a backend and frontend interface. The application will allow users to upload files, process them using a Python backend, and then make the processed files available for download through a web-based frontend interface.

## Project Overview

To create a user-friendly web application that leverages Python's processing capabilities to manipulate user-uploaded files and provide an intuitive interface for file management.

### Context
In today's digital landscape, there is a growing need for accessible tools that can process files efficiently. This application aims to bridge the gap between complex backend operations and user-friendly frontend interactions.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Development of a Python backend for file processing
- Creation of a web-based frontend interface
- File upload functionality
- File processing capabilities
- Processed file download feature
- User authentication system

### Out of Scope
- Mobile application development
- Advanced file editing features
- Real-time collaboration tools

## Business Requirements

   - The interface shall be responsive and compatible with desktop and mobile devices.

2. **File Upload**
   - Users shall be able to upload files through the web interface.
   - The system shall support common file formats (e.g., .txt, .csv, .pdf).
   - Maximum file size limit shall be set to 10MB.

3. **File Processing**
   - The Python backend shall be capable of processing uploaded files based on predefined algorithms.
   - Processing options shall include text extraction, data formatting, and basic analysis.

4. **File Download**
   - Processed files shall be made available for download through the web interface.
   - Users shall be able to see a list of their processed files.

5. **User Authentication**
   - The application shall require user registration and login.
   - User data and processed files shall be associated with individual user accounts.

6. **Data Security**
   - All data transmissions shall be encrypted using HTTPS.
   - User passwords shall be securely hashed and stored.

7. **Performance**
   - The application shall support concurrent users (up to 100 simultaneous connections).
   - File processing shall not exceed 60 seconds for files up to 10MB in size.

8. **Backend API Endpoints**
   The backend shall provide the following API endpoints:
   - File Upload: `POST /api/upload`
   - File Processing: `POST /api/process/<file_id>`
   - File Download: `GET /api/download/<file_id>`
   - File List: `GET /api/files`
   - User Authentication:
     - Login: `POST /api/login`
     - Register: `POST /api/register`
     - Logout: `POST /api/logout`

9. **Frontend Components**
   The frontend shall include the following key components:
   - File Upload Component: For selecting and uploading files
   - File List Component: To display user's files and their processing status
   - File Processing Component: To select processing options and initiate processing
   - File Download Component: To facilitate file downloads
   - User Authentication Components: Including login form, registration form, and logout button
   - Navigation Component: For easy navigation between application sections
   - Main Dashboard Component: To integrate other components and manage overall layout

## Stakeholders

- Project Manager  
- Backend Developer  
- Frontend Developer  
- UI/UX Designer  
- Quality Assurance Tester  
- End Users  

## Success Factors

- Successful implementation of file upload, processing, and download features  
- Intuitive and responsive user interface  
- Secure user authentication system  
- Efficient file processing with minimal delays  

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users have basic computer literacy and familiarity with web applications.
- The development team has expertise in Python and web technologies.

### Constraints
- The project must be completed within a 3-month timeframe.
- The application must be deployable on cloud platforms for scalability.

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Flask or Django framework for API development  
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for data storage  
- Implementation of specified API endpoints (upload, process, download, file list, authentication)

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript  
- React.js for building the user interface  
- Implementation of specified components (file upload, file list, file processing, file download, authentication, navigation, dashboard)

### Deployment
- Docker for containerization  
- Cloud hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Endpoints

1. **File Upload Endpoint (`POST /api/upload`)**  
   - Receives files from the frontend  
   - Saves files to a designated directory  
   - Initiates processing if required  

2. **File Processing Endpoint (`POST /api/process/<file_id>`)**  
   - Processes the uploaded file based on predefined algorithms  
   - Updates file status in the database  

3. **File Download Endpoint (`GET /api/download/<file_id`)**  
   - Retrieves the processed file  
   - Sends the file to the client for download  

4. **File List Endpoint (`GET /api/files`)**  
   - Returns a list of files associated with the authenticated user  

5. **User Authentication Endpoints**  
   Handles user registration, login, and logout processes  

### Frontend Components

1. **File Upload Component**  
    Provides a form with file input field and submit button to handle file selection and upload to the server  

2. **File List Component**  
    Displays the list of user's files and their processing status; also provides options to process or download each file  

3. **File Processing Component**  
    Allows users to select processing options; initiates file processing  

4. **File Download Component**  
    Provides functionality to download processed files  

5. **User Authentication Components**  
    Includes login form, registration form, and logout button; manages user session state  

6. **Navigation Component**  
    Provides links to different sections of the application  

7. **Main Dashboard Component**  
    Integrates other components; manages overall layout of the application  

## Future Considerations
